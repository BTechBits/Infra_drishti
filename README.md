# 🏗️ INFRA-DRISHTI  
### A Vision Towards Safer Infrastructure in India 🇮🇳

> **Predicting infrastructure failure before damage is done.**  
> From reactive repairs to proactive prevention.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

India’s public infrastructure — **bridges, flyovers, roads, tunnels** — is deteriorating silently.  
Failures are addressed **after** disasters occur, resulting in:

- Loss of lives  
- Massive economic damage  
- Traffic paralysis & public distrust  

Between **2021–2025**, over **50 major infrastructure collapses** exposed critical gaps in monitoring, maintenance, and early warning systems.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: INFRA-DRISHTI

**INFRA-DRISHTI** is a **predictive web platform** that analyzes infrastructure health using:

- Environmental data (weather, rainfall, climate)
- Traffic load patterns
- Historical incidents
- Geographical & stress indicators

It **predicts risk before failure**, enabling authorities to act early and save lives.

## 🧠 Meaning Behind the Name

- **INFRA** → Backbone of society: roads, bridges, buildings  
- **DRISHTI** → Vision, foresight, early warning  

Together:  
> **“Vision for Infrastructure”** — seeing failures before they happen.
